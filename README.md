# Clockwise Controller Boards Repository

This repository serves as the central hub for controller boards designed for the [Clockwise project](https://github.com/jnthas/clockwise).

## What is this repository for?

The goal is to maintain and share open hardware designs for various controller boards that can be used with Clockwise. These controller boards are the “brains” that drive the electronics in your Clockwise project.

## Philosophy

- **Modularity:** Support multiple MCUs (microcontroller units) to maximize flexibility.
- **DIY and Accessibility:** Offer designs that are easy for users to build at home, as well as options focused on small size and low cost.
- **Diversity:** Grow the ecosystem by adding boards for a range of microcontrollers, such as ESP32 variants, Raspberry Pi Pico, and more.

## Boards

### WiseShield-32

- The first controller board in this repository.
- Uses an ESP32 Dev Board as its MCU.
- Design focuses on maker-friendliness, available gerbers and source files.

## How to contribute

If you have an idea, improvement, or want to add your own controller board design, please open an issue or a pull request!
